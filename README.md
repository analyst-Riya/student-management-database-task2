# Student Management Database – Task 2

This project is part of my internship at @Main Crafts Technology.  
In this task, I extended the existing Student Management Database by adding new tables and performing advanced SQL operations.

- Added *Courses* and *Enrollments* tables.  
- Established relationships between *Students, **Courses, and **Enrollments*.  
- Performed *JOIN* and *Aggregation* queries to analyze student data.

## 🧩 Features
- Table creation with constraints (Primary Key, Foreign Key)
- Join queries
- Aggregation functions (AVG, COUNT, SUM)
- Queries for course-wise and student-wise performance
